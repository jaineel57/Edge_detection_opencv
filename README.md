# Edge_detection_opencv

Real-Time Edge Detection using OpenCV in Python using Canny Edge Detection Method.

The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time. The popular canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. 
OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments.

Libraries Required:

- OpenCV
- Numpy
